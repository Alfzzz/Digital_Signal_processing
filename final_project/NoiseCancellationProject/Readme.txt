This folder contains the Digital Signal Processing Laboratory Project of the semester. We made a noise cancellation algorithm by using audio signals. 

Two approaches were developed. The first one consists on using notch filters to attenuate the frequency componentes of the signal where the noise is located. The second one uses the Short-time Fourier Transform(STFT) to analyse the signal in time-frequency and the noise is cancelled before reconstructing the signal.

There are a MATLAB script and a MATLAB live script for each approach in this folder. A Graphical User Interface(GUI) is also developed for the user.
